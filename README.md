Hello, I'm Çınar Civan! I'm the co-founder of Sci-Hook Organization. I develop web projects and I am interested in 	embedded system programming. I make sure that the projects I develop are open-source and I contribute to open-source projects. We share the tools, systems and software projects we develop at Sci-Hook Organization in an open source way. You can browse Sci-Hook Organization's GitHub account [here](https://github.com/Sci-Hook).

I work in science communication and I am a science editor. I am the general editor at [Tree of Evolution](https://evrimagaci.org/cinarcivan), Turkey's largest science communication platform. I am also the founder and editor-in-chief of Sci-Hook's science communication platform [Bilimetri](https://www.bilimetri.org/).
